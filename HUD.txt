Customizing HUD and its control with a Leap Motion

Abstract:

In todays cars, the design of a Head Up Display (HUD) and the arrangement of its components are rather fixed. In a world where everyone
wants to be able to customize everything according to their needs, this paper shows our ideas on how to implement a HUD
for cars which can be modifyed using simple gestures. The paper also provides approaches how a Leap Motion can be used
to recognize gestures in order to control the HUD. Furthermore, user experiences, possible risks and problems we faces
in the implementation will be described within this paper.

Introduction:

Automotive UI - a very interesting topic. But still, finding an idea which has never been considered before is very hard.
Therefore, we thought about existing UIs in cars and how we can change the interaction with the user. In particular, this
paper describes an approach on how a dynamic HUD can be designed and how its control can be realized with the help of a
Leap Motion. The control will be handled by gestures only, so no touchpad or any other device than the Leap Motion is
needed to modify the HUD.
